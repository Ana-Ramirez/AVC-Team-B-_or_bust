Week 1 Review:
(Since it was the holidays, we only set up very simple goals as we knew we would not be able to complete much while away from uni).
Everyone completed their respective tasks for this week and we got the AVC plan in on time before the holidays.

Week 2 Plan (28th April, During and after the holidays):
(Minor work as part of this week is during the holidays and wouldnt be able to organise team meetings)
Andrew: Review and go over the skeleton code
David: Planning of the code to get the sensor working
Daniel V: Planning the code to get the robot working
Daniel S: Startng designing hardware construction
Ana: Arrange communication, sorting out meetings outside of lab time.

Week 2 Review:
Because of the holidays, again we couldn't get a lot done in terms of coding, but we did as a group go over the skeleton code and began planning how to go about building on the skeleton code to get the basic function of the robot working.
Daniel made a full detailed plan of the design and hardware of the robot that he created on Blender. He had also already 3D printed a few of the basic components of the hardware.

Week 3 Plan (5th May):

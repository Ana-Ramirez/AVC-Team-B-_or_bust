# AVC-Team-B-_or_bust
Team repository for the AVC Project in ENGR101.
Team members include: David Scott, Daniel Sommerville, Ana Ramirez, Daniel Van Eijck and Andrew Woollett


Week 1 Plan (22nd April, just before the holidays/during the holidays)
Andrew: Set up the Github repository
David: Go over the AVC plan to make sure everything is completed
Daniel: SSH into the RPi
Daniel S: Put together the initial hardware components
Ana: Create weekly plan (table) and get key dates and people organised

Week 1 Review:
(Since it was the holidays, we only set up very simple goals as we knew we would not be able to complete much while away from uni).
Everyone completed their respective tasks for this week and we got the AVC plan in on time before the holidays.

Week 2 Plan (28th April, During and after the holidays):
(Minor work as part of this week is during the holidays and wouldnt be able to organise team meetings)
Andrew: Review and go over the skeleton code
David: Planning of the code to get the sensor working
Daniel V: Planning the code to get the robot working
Daniel S: Startng designing hardware construction
Ana: Arrange communication, sorting out meetings outside of lab time.

Week 2 Review:
Because of the holidays, again we couldn't get a lot done in terms of coding, but we did as a group go over the skeleton code and began planning how to go about building on the skeleton code to get the basic function of the robot working.
Daniel made a full detailed plan of the design and hardware of the robot that he created on Blender. He had also already 3D printed a few of the basic components of the hardware.
Daniel V, Andrew, and Ana had a few problems with SSH-ing into the Rpi and finding the IP address, but this was just through simple errors of our own, rather than technical issues with the RPi.

Week 3 Plan (5th May):
Andrew: Begin coding to get the sensors working so that the basic "detection" part of the robot is operational
David: Continue producing documentation and overseeing and providing help with software
Daniel V: With Andrew, begin coding to get the sensors working so that the basic "detection" part of the robot is operational and begin on the basic movement of the robot
Daniel S: Continue with the construction, design, and printing of the hardware to have it completed by the start of our next official lab time (12th May).
Ana: Arrange meetings and delegate tasks as well as assist with the documentation and software

Week 3 Review:
We had a few issues this week with our RPi. On Friday, our robot short circuited, we believe because Daniel was constructing the robot while it was still turned on, resulting in a lot of our planned meeting time being used by trying to fix it. In the end, we had a to ask Elf for help, who gave us a new SD card.
This meant that we lost a lot of the code that we'd been working on since we were working on the Pi itself and hadn't uploaded any of the code to GitHub. Because of this, we've had to work significantly harder this week in order to regain our lost time and files.
Aside from our issues, Daniel S successfully completed printing out all the hardware and construction of the robot so that it is practical and functional, yet follows the "aesthetic" requirements of the project.
Andrew and Daniel S have both been working on regaining and improving the code that we have lost, with assistance from David and Ana. At the end of this week we have committed and saved and committed several files to GitHub for the software, but haven't actually run or tested anything yet, which we plan to do in our next meeting (12th May).

Week 4 Plan (12th May):
As an overall goal as a group, by our next designated lab time, we aim to be testing our robot on the official board, and hopefully be running the robot up to the B- mark (end of the second quadrant).
Andrew: Develop the code to enable the robot to turn at dead ends
David: Continue with documentation and assist with developing the code to get the robot to turn around the curved corners
Daniel V: Develop the code to enable the robot to turn at dead ends
Daniel S: Design a new back wheel and figure out a way for the robot to fit turn inside the maze.
Ana: Continue with documentation and assist with developing the code to get the robot to turn around the curved corners, as well as go over the code to get the gate opening (written by Daniel V), test it, and get it functional.

Week 4 Review (so far):
David has not showed up for our Thursday lab or the extra meeting we scheduled on Friday (absence yet to be explained).
Daniel S put the finishing touches on the hardware of robot, so that this part is complete so we are now free to run code on the robot to test it officially. We ran into a few problems when trying to test our code, one of them being that our RPi didn't have the lt and makefile files. So we asked Arthur and he gave us another updated SD card (again) with the correct files on it this time. By the end of Thursday's lab we had the robot moving and operational. It could roughly dectect a line and attempts very roughly to rectify itself back onto the line when it goes astray, however, we are still very pleased with this progress.
After our extra meeting on Friday (attended by Daniel V, Daniel S, and Ana), we made even further progress. We haven't got the gate working yet as we have been concentrating on getting the robot to follow the path, which at the moment it successfully does up until the second curve in the path (it can get through the first curve as it is not as sharp as the second curve).

I designed the AV to be circular in shape so it could turn around in the maze. 
I set the camera to be adjustable, both in angle and height so we can adjust it if needed.
I moved the IR sensors away from the edge so they were not too close to the edge which would result in a wrong number.
The base of the robot was printed in 2 parts due to the size of the 3D printer. These parts were screwed together not glued, so they could be easily removed, replaced or recycled.
The wires on the motors were cut to the right length so they didnâ€™t get in the way.
I did not use tracks because they had to have exact measurements and would be more complicated to manage. 
I will create a new back wheel, the current one can affect the direction of the AVC.
The measurements are: length 19.6 cm. width 11 cm. height 13 cm.
The 3D printer is limited to 12,12,12 cm.
when I moved the camera to the new position on the front, it is now too long for the maze. I will fix this nex week.

I just read that we shouldn't speak in first or second person. So the first line should be: The AV was designed to be circular in shape so it could turn around in the maze.
